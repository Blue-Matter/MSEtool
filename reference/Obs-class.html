<dt><code>Name</code></dt><dd><p>The name of the Observation error object. Single value. Character
string.</p></dd>

<dt><code>Cobs</code></dt><dd><p>Observation error around the total catch. Observation error in
the total catch is expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV). Cobs requires
upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution, and for each simulation a CV
is sampled from this distribution. Each CV is used to specify a log-normal
error distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the
sampled CV. The yearly observation error values for the catch data are then
drawn from this distribution. For each time step the simulation model records
the true catch, but the observed catch is generated by applying this yearly
error term (plus any bias, if specified) to the true catch.</p></dd>

<dt><code>Cbiascv</code></dt><dd><p>Log-normally distributed coefficient of variation controlling
the sampling bias in observed catch for each simulation. Bias occurs when
catches are systematically skewed away from the true catch level (for example,
due to underreporting of catch or undetected illegal catches). Cbiascv is a
single value specifying the standard deviation of a log-normal distribution
with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the sampled CV. For each
simulation a bias value is drawn from this distribution, and that bias is
applied across all years.</p></dd>

<dt><code>beta</code></dt><dd><p>A parameter controlling hyperstability/hyperdepletion in the
measurement of abundance. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a
uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Values
below 1 lead to hyperstability (the observed index decreases more slowly than

    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="note"><a class="anchor" href="#note"></a>Note</h2>

    <p>Its questionable whether the hyperstability/hyperdepletion should be
categorised as an observation model characteristic as it is most often
driven by fleet dynamics (and therefore should be in the fleet object). Oh
well its here and you might want to make it hyperstable beta &lt; 1 or
hyperdeplete beta &gt; 1, only.</p>
