<dl><dt><code>Name</code></dt>
<dd><p>Identifying name for the fleet. Usually includes location and
gear type.</p></dd>


<dt><code>nyears</code></dt>
<dd><p>The number of years for the historical simulation. Single
value. For example, if the simulated population is assumed to be unfished in
1975 and this is the year you want to start your historical simulations, and
the most recent year for which there is data available is 2019, then nyears
equals 45.</p></dd>


<dt><code>CurrentYr</code></dt>
<dd><p>The last historical year simulated before projections begin.
Single value. Note that this should match the last historical year specified in
the <code>Data</code> object, which is usually the last historical year for which data is
available.</p></dd>


<dt><code>EffYears</code></dt>
<dd><p>Vector indicating the historical years where there is
information available to infer the relative fishing effort expended.This vector
is specified in terms of the position of the year in the vector rather than the
calendar year. For example, say our simulation starts with an unfished stock in
1975,and the current year (the last year for which there is data available) is
2019. Then there are 45 historical years simulated, and EffYears should include
numbers between 1 and 45. Note that there may not be information available for
every historical year, especially for data poor fisheries. In these situations,
the EffYears vector should include only the positions of the years for which
there is information, and the vector may be shorter than the total number of
simulated historical years (nyears).</p></dd>


<dt><code>EffLower</code></dt>
<dd><p>Lower bound on relative fishing effort corresponding to
EffYears. EffLower must be a vector that is the same length as EffYears
describing how fishing effort has changed over time. Information on relative
fishing effort can be entered in any units provided they are consistent across
the entire vector because the data provided will be scaled to 1 (divided by the
maximum number provided).</p></dd>


<dt><code>EffUpper</code></dt>
<dd><p>Upper bound on relative fishing effort corresponding to
EffYears. EffUpper must be a vector that is the same length as EffYears
describing how fishing effort has changed over time. Information on relative
fishing effort can be entered in any units provided they are consistent across
the entire vector because the data provided will be scaled to 1 (divided by the
maximum number provided).</p></dd>


<dt><code>Esd</code></dt>
<dd><p>Additional inter-annual variability in fishing mortality rate. For
each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution
specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. If this parameter has a
positive (non-zero) value, the yearly fishing mortality rate is drawn from a
log-normal distribution with a standard deviation (in log space) specified by
the value of <code>Esd</code> drawn for that simulation. This parameter applies only to
historical projections.</p></dd>


<dt><code>qinc</code></dt>
<dd><p>Mean temporal trend in catchability (also though of as the
efficiency of fishing gear) parameter, expressed as a percentage change in
catchability (q) per year. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a
uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Positive
numbers indicate an increase and negative numbers indicate a decrease. q then
changes by this amount for in each year of the simulation This parameter
applies only to forward projections.</p></dd>


<dt><code>qcv</code></dt>
<dd><p>Inter-annual variability in catchability expressed as a
coefficient of variation. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a
uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This
parameter applies only to forward projections.</p></dd>


<dt><code>L5</code></dt>
<dd><p>Shortest length at which 5% of the population is vulnerable to
selection by the gear used in this fleet. Values can either be specified as
lengths (in the same units used for the maturity and growth parameters in the
stock object) or as a percentage of the size of maturity (see the parameter
isRel for more information). For each simulation a single value is drawn from a
uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This
value is the same in all years unless cpars is used to provide time-varying
selection.</p></dd>


<dt><code>LFS</code></dt>
<dd><p>Shortest length at which 100% of the population is vulnerable to
selection by the gear used by this fleet. Values can either be specified as
lengths (in the same units used for the maturity and growth parameters in the
stock object) or as a percentage of the size of maturity (see the parameter
isRel for more information). For each simulation a single value is drawn from a
uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This
value is the same in all years unless cpars is used to provide time-varying
selection.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Vmaxlen</code></dt>
<dd><p>Proportion of fish selected by the gear at the asymptotic
length (<code>Stock@Linf</code>). Upper and Lower bounds between 0 and 1.  A value of
1 indicates that 100% of fish are selected at the asymptotic length, and the
selection curve is logistic. If <code>Vmaxlen</code> is less than 1 the selection curve is
dome shaped. For example, if <code>Vmaxlen</code> is 0.4, then only 40% of fish are
vulnerable to the fishing gear at the asymptotic length.</p></dd>


<dt><code>isRel</code></dt>
<dd><p>Specify whether selection and retention parameters use absolute
lengths or relative to the size of maturity. Single logical value (TRUE or
FALSE).</p></dd>


<dt><code>LR5</code></dt>
<dd><p>Shortest length at which 5% of the population is vulnerable to
retention by the fleet. Values can either be specified as lengths (in the same
units used for the maturity and growth parameters in the stock object) or as a
percentage of the size of maturity (see the parameter isRel for more
information). For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform
distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is
the same in all years unless cpars is used to provide time-varying selection.</p></dd>


<dt><code>LFR</code></dt>
<dd><p>Shortest length where 100% of the population is vulnerable to
retention by the fleet. Values can either be specified as lengths (in the same
units used for the maturity and growth parameters in the stock object) or as a
percentage of the size of maturity (see the parameter <code>isRel</code> for more
information). For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform
distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is
the same in all years unless cpars is used to provide time-varying selection.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Rmaxlen</code></dt>
<dd><p>Proportion of fish retained at the asymptotic length
(<code>Stock@Linf</code>). Upper and Lower bounds between 0 and 1.  A value of 1
indicates that 100% of fish are retained at the asymptotic length, and the
selection curve is logistic. If <code>Rmaxlen</code> is less than 1 the retention curve is
dome shaped. For example, if <code>Rmaxlen</code> is 0.4, then only 40% of fish at the
asymptotic length are retained.</p></dd>


<dt><code>DR</code></dt>
<dd><p>Discard rate, defined as the proportion of fully selected fish that
are discarded by the fleet. Upper and Lower bounds between 0 and 1, with a
value of 1 indicates that 100% of selected fish are discarded. For each
simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the
upper and lower bounds provided.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Spat_targ</code></dt>
<dd><p>Distribution of fishing in relation to vulnerable biomass
(VB) across areas. The distribution of fishing effort is proportional to
VB^Spat_targ. Upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution. For each
simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the
upper and lower bounds provided. This parameter allows the user to model either
avoidance or spatial targeting behavior by the fleet. If the parameter value is
1, fishing effort is allocated across areas in proportion to the population
density of that area. Values below 1 simulate an avoidance behavior and values
above 1 simulate a targeting behavior.</p></dd>


<dt><code>MPA</code></dt>
<dd><p>Logical argument (TRUE or FALSE). Creates an MPA in Area 1 for all
years if true is selected. Defaults to FALSE.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Misc</code></dt>
<dd><p>Miscellaneous list for bio-economic parameters</p></dd>
