<dd><p>Common name of the species. Character string.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Species</code></dt>
<dd><p>Scientific name of the species. Genus and species name.
Character string.</p></dd>


<dt><code>maxage</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum age of individuals that is simulated. There are
<code>maxage+1</code> (recruitment to age-0) age classes in the storage matrices.

unless option switched off with <code>OM@cpars$plusgroup=0</code>. Single value.
Positive integer.</p></dd>


<dt><code>R0</code></dt>
<dd><p>Initial number of unfished recruits to age-0. This number is used
to scale the size of the population to match catch or data, but does not affect
any of the population dynamics unless the OM has been conditioned with data. As
a result, for a data-limited fishery any number can be used for <code>R0</code>. In
data-rich stocks <code>R0</code> may be estimated as part of a stock assessment, but for
data limited stocks users can choose either an arbitrary number (say, 1000) or
choose a number that produces simulated catches in recent historical years that
are similar to real world catch data. Single value. Positive real number.</p></dd>

<dd><p>Inter-annual variation in <code>M</code> expressed as a coefficient of
variation of a log-normal distribution. For each simulation a single value is
drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds

the same in all years unless <code>Linfsd</code> is a positive number. Uniform
distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Linfsd</code></dt>
<dd><p>Inter-annual variation in Linf. For each simulation a single
value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower
bounds provided. If this parameter has a positive value, yearly Linf is drawn
from a log-normal distribution with a mean specified by the value of <code>Linf</code>
drawn for that simulation and a standard deviation (in log space) specified by
the value of <code>Linfsd</code> drawn for that simulation. Uniform distribution lower and
upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>K</code></dt>
<dd><p>The von Bertalanffy growth parameter k, which specifies the average
rate of growth. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform
distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is
the same in all years unless <code>Ksd</code> is a positive number. Uniform distribution
lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Ksd</code></dt>
<dd><p>Inter-annual variation in K. For each simulation a single value is
drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds
provided. If this parameter has a positive value, yearly K is drawn from a
log-normal distribution with a mean specified by the value of <code>K</code> drawn for

of <code>Ksd</code> drawn for that simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper
bounds. Non-negative real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>t0</code></dt>
<dd><p>The von Bertalanffy growth parameter t0, which specifies the
theoretical age at a size 0. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a
uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Uniform
distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-positive real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>LenCV</code></dt>
<dd><p>The coefficient of variation (defined as the standard deviation
divided by mean) of the length-at-age.  For each simulation a single value is
drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds
provided to specify the distribution of observed length-at-age, and the CV of
this distribution is constant for all age classes (i.e, standard deviation
increases proportionally with the mean). Uniform distribution lower and upper
bounds. Positive real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>L50</code></dt>
<dd><p>Length at 50% maturity. For each simulation a single value is
drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds
provided. The <code>L50</code> and <code>L50_95</code> parameters are converted to ages using the
growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to determine
the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class. Uniform
distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>L50_95</code></dt>
<dd><p>Difference in lengths between 50% and 95% maturity. For each
simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the
upper and lower bounds provided. The value drawn is then added to the length at
50% maturity to determine the length at 95% maturity. This parameterization is
used <code>instead</code> of specifying the size at 95 percent maturity to avoid
situations where the value drawn for the size at 95% maturity is smaller than
that at 50% maturity. The <code>L50</code> and <code>L50_95</code> parameters are converted to ages
using the growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to
determine the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class.
Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>D</code></dt>
<dd><p>Estimated current level of stock depletion, which is defined as the
current spawning stock biomass divided by the unfished spawning stock biomass.
For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution
specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This parameter is used during
model initialization to select a series of yearly historical recruitment values
and fishing mortality rates that, based on the information provided, could have
resulted in the specified depletion level in the simulated last historical
year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers
(typically &lt; 1)</p></dd>


<dt><code>a</code></dt>
<dd><p>The alpha parameter in allometric length-weight relationship. Single
value. Weight parameters are used to determine catch-at-age and
population-at-age from the number of individuals in each age class and the
length of each individual, which is drawn from a normal distribution determined
by the <code>Linf</code>, <code>K</code>, <code>t0</code>, and <code>LenCV</code> parameters. As a result, they function as
a way to scale between numbers at age and biomass, and are not stochastic
parameters. Single value. Positive real number.</p></dd>


<dt><code>b</code></dt>
<dd><p>The beta parameter in allometric length-weight relationship. Single
value. Weight parameters are used to determine catch-at-age and
population-at-age from the number of individuals in each age class and the
length of each individual, which is drawn from a normal distribution determine
by the <code>Linf</code>, <code>K</code>, <code>t0</code>, and <code>LenCV</code> parameters. As a result, they function as
a way to scale between numbers at age and biomass, and are not stochastic
parameters. Single value. Positive real number.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Size_area_1</code></dt>
<dd><p>The size of area 1 relative to area 2. The fraction of the
unfished biomass in area 1. Please specify numbers between 0 and 1. For each
simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the
upper and lower bounds provided. For example, if Size_area_1 is 0.2, then 20%
of the total area is allocated to area 1. Fishing can occur in both areas, or
can be turned off in one area to simulate the effects of a no take marine
reserve. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Frac_area_1</code></dt>
<dd><p>The fraction of the unfished biomass in area 1. Please
specify numbers between 0 and 1. For each simulation a single value is drawn
from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided.
For example, if Frac_area_1 is 0.5, then 50% of the unfished biomass is
allocated to area 1, regardless of the size of area 1 (i.e, size and fraction
in each area determine the density of fish, which may impact fishing spatial
targeting). In each time step recruits are allocated to each area based on the
proportion specified in Frac_area_1. Uniform distribution lower and upper
bounds. Positive real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Prob_staying</code></dt>
<dd><p>The probability of individuals in area 1 remaining in
area 1 over the course of one year. Please specify numbers between 0 and 1. For
each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified
by the upper and lower bounds provided. For example, in an area with a
Prob_staying value of 0.95 each fish has a 95% probability of staying in that
area in each time step, and a 5% probability of moving to the other area.
Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive fraction.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Fdisc</code></dt>
<dd><p>The instantaneous discard mortality rate the stock experiences
when fished using the gear type specified in the corresponding fleet object and
discarded. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform
distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Uniform
distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.</p></dd>


<dt><code>Source</code></dt>
