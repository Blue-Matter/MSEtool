\arguments{
\item{Name}{Name of the Operating Model. Character string.}

\item{Agency}{Name of the agency responsible for the management of the fishery.
Character string. Supports Markdown.}

\item{Author}{Name(s) of author(s) of the operating model. Character string
with length corresponding to the number of authors.}

\item{Email}{Email address(es) for the author(s) of the operating model.
Character string of with length equal to \code{length(Author)}. Supports Markdown.}

\item{Region}{Name of the general geographic region of the fishery. Character string.}

\item{Latitude}{Latitude (decimal degrees) to indicate the center of \code{Region}.
Negative values represent the South of the Equator. Numeric. Single value.}

\item{Longitude}{Longitude (decimal degrees) to indicate the center of \code{Region}.
Negative values represent the West of the Prime Meridian. Numeric. Single value.}

\item{Sponsor}{Name of the organization who sponsored the development of the
Operating Model. Character string. Supports Markdown.}

\item{nSim}{The number of simulations. Numeric. Positive integer \code{nSim=1} will
produce a deterministic operating model.}

\item{nYear}{The number of historical years. Typically corresponds to the
year the fishery was first (assumed to be) exploited. For multi-stock models,
\code{nYear} should be the earliest exploitation year of all stocks. Numeric.
Single value. Historical years are calculated as \code{rev(seq(CurrentYear, by=-1, length.out=nYear))}}

\item{pYear}{The number of projection years. Numeric. Single value.
Projection years are calculated as \code{seq(CurrentYear+1, length.out=pYear)}.}

\item{CurrentYear}{The last historical year of the operating model. Defaults
to the year the Operating Model object is built.}

\item{Stock}{A \link{Stock} object or a list of \code{\link[=Stock]{Stock()}} objects
for multi-stock models.}

\item{Complexes}{For multi-stock models only. A list of stock complexes.
Each position is a vector of stock numbers (as they appear in \code{Stock} list)
for which data and management recommendation should be aggregated; e.g.,
TAC will be split among stocks according to vulnerable biomass.}

\item{Relations}{For multi-stock models only. A list of biological and/or
ecological relationships among stocks in \code{Stock}. For MICE models. Needs
more documentation so bug us if you get stuck.}

\item{SexPars}{For multi-stock models only. A named list that controls
sex-specific dynamics, i.e., sex-specific spawning and hermaphroditism.
More generally, controls spawning and moving abundance between stocks. See \code{Details}.}

\item{Data}{A \code{\link[=data-class]{data-class()}} object or a list of \code{\link[=data-class]{data-class()}} objects (up to
\code{length(Stock)}) containing the real fishery data.
if \code{Complexes} is specified, \code{Data} follows the same structure, i.e., elements
in \code{Data} list will be assumed to be aggregated according to \code{Complexes}.}

\item{Interval}{The management update interval. Management will be implemented
in the first projection time step, and then every \code{Interval} time step, with
management remaining unchanged in the interim. A single numeric value for the
same interval for all managemement procedures. For MP-specific management
intervals , \code{Interval} can be a named numeric vector with length corresponding
to the number of management procedures used in \code{\link[=runMSE]{runMSE()}} or \code{\link[=Project]{Project()}}.}

\item{nReps}{Number of samples of the management recommendation for each method.
Only for management procedures that generate stochastic management advice (i.e.,
account for uncertainty in the data). Defaults to 1, which produces deterministic
management advice.}

\item{pStar}{The percentile of the sample of the management recommendation for each method.
Defaults to 0.5 (median). Only for management procedures that generate
stochastic management advice (i.e., account for uncertainty in the data).
To ensure the management advice matches the correct percentile, \code{reps} should
be a largish value (i.e., >>1, but exact value depends on the degree of uncertainty in the data)}

\item{Seed}{Optional numeric value for the seed for the random number generator.
Only required to over-ride the default seed (calculated internally based on
the contents of the \code{OM} object)}

\item{Control}{A named list of settings. See \code{Details}}

\item{Misc}{A list for storing additional things that don't have anywhere else to go.
Mainly for development purposes.}

\item{Source}{Character string. Can be used to reference websites, articles, etc
with relevant information. Supports Markdown.}
}
\description{
An object containing all the parameters needed to control the MSE which can
be build from component Stock, Fleet, Obs, and Imp objects.
}
\details{
Almost all of these inputs are a vector of length 2 which describes the upper and lower
bounds of a uniform distribution from which to sample the parameter.
