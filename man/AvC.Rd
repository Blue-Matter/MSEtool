\description{
A simple average catch MP that is included to demonstrate a 'status quo' management option
}
\details{
The average catch method is very simple. The mean historical catch is calculated and used to set
a constant catch limit (TAC). If \code{reps} > 1 then the \code{reps} samples are drawn from a log-normal
distribution with mean \code{TAC} and standard deviation (in log-space) of 0.2.

For completeness, the TAC is calculated by:

\deqn{\textrm{TAC} =\frac{\sum_{y=1}^{\textrm{n}}{C_y}}{\textrm{n}}}

where \eqn{\textrm{TAC}} is the the mean catch recommendation, \eqn{n} is the number of historical years, and
\eqn{C_y}  is the catch in historical year \eqn{y}
