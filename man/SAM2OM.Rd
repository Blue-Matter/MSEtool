\arguments{
\item{fit}{an object of class 'sam' created by sam.fit}

\item{nsim}{Positive integer. The number of simulations.}

\item{proyears}{Positive integer. The number of projection years for MSE.}

\item{interval}{Positive integer. The interval at which management procedures will update the management advice in \link[MSEtool]{runMSE}, e.g., 1 = annual updates.}

\item{Name}{Character string. The name of the operating model.}

\item{WLa}{positive real number or array \verb{[sim, ages, year]}. The default weight-length parameter a (W=aL^b)}

\item{WLb}{positive real number or array \verb{[sim, ages, year]}. The default weight-length parameter b (W=aL^b)}

\item{h}{positive real number, the steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship}

\item{Obs}{The observation model (class Obs). This function only updates the catch and index observation error.}

\item{Imp}{The implementation model (class Imp). This function does not update implementation parameters.}

\item{nyr_par_mu}{Positive integer. The number of recent years that natural mortality, age vulnerability, weight, length and maturity parameters are averaged over for defining future projection conditions.}

\item{LowerTri}{Integer. The number of recent years for which model estimates of recruitment are ignored (not reliably estimated by the assessment)}

\item{plusgroup}{Logical. Does the assessment assume that the oldest age class is a plusgroup?}

\item{altinit}{Integer. Various assumptions for how to set up the initial numbers. 0: standard, 1: no plus group, 2: temporary fix for MSEtool plus group initialization}

\item{fixq1}{Logical. Should q be fixed (ie assume the F-at-age array faa is accurate?}

\item{report}{Logical, if TRUE, a diagnostic will be reported showing the matching of the OM reconstructed numbers at age vs the assessment.}

\item{stoch}{Logical, should stochasticity in historical stock and fleet dynamics be simulated?}

\item{silent}{Whether to silence messages to the console.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
An object of class \linkS4class{OM}.
}
\description{
Takes a fitted SAM model and samples historical population and fishing dynamics from the MLE fit and variance-covariance matrix.
Maturity-at-age-year, Mortality-at-age-year and weight-at-age-year are identical among simulations and are a direct copy of the matrices in the WHAM fitting object.
}
\details{
Use a seed for the random number generator to sample future recruitment.
