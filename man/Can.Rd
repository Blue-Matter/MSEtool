\title{Identify management procedures (MPs) based on data availability}
\usage{
Can(Data, timelimit = 1, MPs = NA, dev = FALSE, silent = FALSE)

Cant(Data, timelimit = 1, silent = FALSE)

DLMdiag(
  Data,
  command = c("available", "not available", "needed"),
  reps = 5,
  timelimit = 1,
  funcs1 = NA,
  dev = FALSE,
  silent = FALSE
)

Needed(Data, timelimit = 1, silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object (class Data)}

\item{timelimit}{The maximum time (seconds) taken for an MP to undertake
5 reps (this filters out methods that are too slow)}

\item{MPs}{Optional list of MP names}

\item{dev}{Logical. Run in development mode?}

\item{silent}{Logical Display messages?}

\item{command}{What to calculate? Character. Options = c("available", "not available", "needed")}

\item{reps}{The number of replicates for the MP}

\item{funcs1}{A character vector of the MP names (optional)}
}
\description{
Diagnostic tools that look up the slot requirements of each MP and
compares to the data available in the Data object.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{Can()}: Identifies MPs that have the correct data, do not produce errors,
and run within the time limit.

\item \code{Cant()}: Identifies MPs that don't have sufficient data, lead to errors, or don't run in
time along with a list of their data requirements.

\item \code{DLMdiag()}: Internal function called by \code{Can} and \code{Cant}

\item \code{Needed()}: Identifies what data are needed to run
the MPs that are currently not able to run given a Data
object
