\arguments{
\item{Name}{Character string. The name of the operating model.}

\item{proyears}{Positive integer. The number of projection years for MSE.}

\item{interval}{Positive integer. The interval at which management procedures will update the management advice in \link[MSEtool]{runMSE}, e.g., 1 = annual updates.}

\item{CurrentYr}{Positive integer. The current year (final year of fitting to data)}

\item{h}{The steepness of the stock-recruitment curve (greater than 0.2 and less than 1, assumed to be close to 1 to match VPA assumption).
Either a single numeric or a length nsim vector.}

\item{Obs}{The observation model (class Obs). This function only updates the catch and index observation error.}

\item{Imp}{The implementation model (class Imp). This function does not update implementation parameters.}

\item{naa}{Numeric array \verb{[sim, ages, year]}. Numbers-at-age \verb{[first age is age zero]}.}

\item{faa}{Numeric array \verb{[sim, ages, year]}. Fishing mortality rate-at-age \verb{[first age is age zero]}.}

\item{waa}{Numeric array \verb{[sim, ages, year]}. Weight-at-age \verb{[first age is age zero]}.}

\item{Mataa}{Numeric array \verb{[sim, ages, year]}. Maturity (spawning fraction)-at-age \verb{[first age is age zero]}.}

\item{Maa}{Numeric array \verb{[sim, ages, year]}. Natural mortality rate-at-age \verb{[first age is age zero]}.}

\item{laa}{Numeric array \verb{[sim, ages, year]}. Length-at-age \verb{[first age is age zero]}.}

\item{nyr_par_mu}{Positive integer. The number of recent years that natural mortality, age vulnerability, weight, length and maturity parameters are averaged over for defining future projection conditions.}

\item{LowerTri}{Integer. The number of recent years for which model estimates of recruitment are ignored (not reliably estimated by the assessment)}

\item{recind}{Positive integer. The first age class that fish 'recruit to the fishery'. The default is 0 - ie the first position in the age dimension of naa is age zero}

\item{plusgroup}{Logical. Does the assessment assume that the oldest age class is a plusgroup?}

\item{altinit}{Integer. Various assumptions for how to set up the initial numbers. 0: standard, 1: no plus group, 2: temporary fix for MSEtool plus group initialization}

\item{fixq1}{Logical. Should q be fixed (ie assume the F-at-age array faa is accurate?}

\item{report}{Logical, if TRUE, a diagnostic will be reported showing the matching of the OM reconstructed numbers at age vs the assessment.}

\item{silent}{Whether to silence messages to the console.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (for all, either a numeric or a length nsim vector):
\itemize{
\item \code{fecaa} Fecundity at age. Default fecundity is the product of maturity and weight at age.
\item \code{SRrel} Stock-recruit relationship. (\code{1} for Beverton-Holt (default), \code{2} for Ricker)
\item \code{R0} unfished recruitment
\item \code{phi0} unfished spawners per recruit associated with R0 and h. With time-varying parameters, openMSE uses the mean phi0
in the first \code{ageM} (age of 50 percent maturity) years for the stock-recruit relationship. \code{Assess2OM} will re-calculate R0 and h
in the operating model such that the stock-recruit \code{alpha} and \code{beta} parameters match values implied in the input.
\item \code{Perr} recruitment standard deviation (lognormal distribution) for sampling future recruitment
\item \code{AC} autocorrelation in future recruitment deviates.
\item \code{spawn_time_frac} The fraction of a year when spawning takes place (e.g., 0.5 is the midpoint of the year)
}}
}
\value{
An object of class \linkS4class{OM}.

\description{
A function that uses a set of bootstrap estimates of numbers-at-age, fishing mortality rate-at-age, M-at-age,
weight-at-age, length-at-age and Maturity-at-age to define a fully described MSEtool operating model. The user still
needs to parameterize most of the observation and implementation portions of the operating model.
}
\details{
Use a seed for the random number generator to sample future recruitment.
