\title{Class \code{'MOM'}}
\description{
An object containing all the parameters needed to control a multi-stock, multi-fleet MSE which can
be build from component Stock, Fleet, Obs, and Imp objects.
}
\details{
Almost all of these inputs are a vector of length 2 which describes the upper and lower
bounds of a uniform distribution from which to sample the parameter.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{Name}}{Name of the operating model}

\item{\code{Agency}}{Name of the agency responsible for the management of the fishery. Character string}

\item{\code{Region}}{Name of the general geographic region of the fishery. Character string}

\item{\code{Sponsor}}{Name of the organization who sponsored the OM. Character string}

\item{\code{Latitude}}{Latitude (decimal degrees). Negative values represent the South of the Equator. Numeric. Single value}

\item{\code{Longitude}}{Longitude (decimal degrees). Negative values represent the West of the Prime Meridian. Numeric. Single value}

\item{\code{nsim}}{The number of simulations}

\item{\code{proyears}}{The number of projected years}

\item{\code{interval}}{The assessment interval - how often would you like to update the management system?}

\item{\code{pstar}}{The percentile of the sample of the management recommendation for each method}

\item{\code{maxF}}{Maximum instantaneous fishing mortality rate that may be simulated for any given age class}

\item{\code{reps}}{Number of samples of the management recommendation for each method. Note that when this is set to 1, the mean value of
the data inputs is used.}

\item{\code{cpars}}{A hierarcical list nstock then nfleet long of custom parameters. Time series are a matrix nsim rows by nyears columns. Single parameters are a vector nsim long}

\item{\code{seed}}{A random seed to ensure users can reproduce results exactly}

\item{\code{Source}}{A reference to a website or article from which parameters were taken to define the operating model}

\item{\code{Stocks}}{List of stock objects}

\item{\code{Fleets}}{List of Fleet objects}

\item{\code{Obs}}{Hierarchical List of Observation model objects Level 1 is stock, level 2 is fleet}

\item{\code{Imps}}{Hierarchical List of Implementation model objects Level 1 is stock, level 2 is fleet}

\item{\code{CatchFrac}}{A list nstock long, of matrices nsim x nfleet representing the fraction of current catches of the various fleets to each stock (each matrix is nsim by nfleet long and rows sum to 1 for each stock)}

\item{\code{Allocation}}{A list nstock long, of matrices nsim x nfleet representing the fraction of future TACs of the various fleets to each stock (each matrix is nsim by nfleet long and rows sum to 1 for each stock).}

\item{\code{Efactor}}{A list nstock long, of current effort factors by fleet (default is 1 - same as current effort)}

\item{\code{Complexes}}{A list of stock complexes. Each position is a vector of stock numbers (as they appear in StockPars) for which data should be aggregated and TAC recommendations split among stocks according to vulnerable biomass}

\item{\code{SexPars}}{A list of slots that control sex-specific dynamics}

\item{\code{Rel}}{A list of biological / ecological relationships among stocks
over-ridden if an MP of class 'MP_F" is supplied that is a multi-fleet MP.}
