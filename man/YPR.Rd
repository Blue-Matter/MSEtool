\title{Yield Per Recruit analysis to get FMSY proxy F01}
\usage{
YPR(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE)

YPR_CC(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE, Fmin = 0.005)

YPR_ML(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{A data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s)}

\item{plot}{Logical. Show the plot?}

\item{Fmin}{The minimum fishing mortality rate inferred from the catch-curve
analysis}
}

\description{
A simple yield per recruit approximation to FMSY (F01) which is the position
of the ascending YPR curve for which dYPR/dF = 0.1(dYPR/d0)
}
\details{
The TAC is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC} = F_{0.1} A}
where \eqn{F_{0.1}} is the fishing mortality (\emph{F}) where the slope of the yield-per-recruit
(YPR) curve is 10\\% of the slope at the origin, and \emph{A} is an estimate of current abundance.

The YPR curve is calculated using an equilibrium age-structured model with life-history and
selectivity parameters sampled from the \code{Data} object.

The variants of the YPR MP differ in the method to estimate current abundance (see Functions section below). #'
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{YPR}: Requires an external estimate of abundance.

\item \code{YPR_CC}: A catch-curve analysis is used to determine recent Z which given M (Mort)
gives F and thus abundance = Ct/(1-exp(-F))

\item \code{YPR_ML}: A mean-length estimate of recent Z is used to infer current
abundance.
