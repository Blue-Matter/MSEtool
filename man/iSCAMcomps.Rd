\description{
iSCAM assessments are often fitted to numerous fleets that have differing
age selectivities. iSCAMcomps is a simple way of providing the aggregate catch at age
data. It should be noted that this process is important and in a real application would
require due diligence (ie peer reviewed data workshop).
