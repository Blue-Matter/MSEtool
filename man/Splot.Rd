\usage{
Splot(MSEobj, MPs = 5, p = c(0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95))
}
\arguments{
\item{MSEobj}{Object of class 'MSE' from runMSE() or Project()}

\item{MPs}{Either a positive integer (the first MPs number of MPs to plot), a character vector (the names of the MPs to plot), or an integer vector (the index of the MPs to plot)}

\item{p}{Vector of quantiles five positions long. Defaults to c(0.05,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.95) so the 90\% and 50\% intervals with the median plotted  in white.}
