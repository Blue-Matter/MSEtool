\title{Iterative Index Target MP}
\usage{
IT5(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE, yrsmth = 5, mc = 0.05)

IT10(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE, yrsmth = 5, mc = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{A data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s)}

\item{plot}{Logical. Show the plot?}

\item{yrsmth}{The number of historical years over which to average the index}

\item{mc}{The maximum fractional change in the TAC among years.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[=Rec-class]{Rec}} with the TAC slot(s) populated
}
\description{
An index target MP where the TAC is modified according to current index
levels (mean index over last 5 years) relative to a target level.
}
\details{
The TAC is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC}_y = C_{y-1} I_\delta}
where \eqn{C_{y-1}} is the catch from the previous year and \eqn{I_\delta} is
the ratio of the mean index over the past \code{yrsmth} years to a reference index level.
The maximum allowable change in TAC is determined by \code{mc}: e.g \code{mc=0.05}
means that the maximum change in TAC from the previous
catch is 5\%.

The reference index level (\code{Data@Iref}) is assumed to be a proxy for MSY. In the
MSE \code{Iref} is the index at MSY subject to observation error (\code{Obs@Irefbiascv}).
Consequently the performance of these methods in MSE is strongly determined by the
uncertainty the in reference index.
