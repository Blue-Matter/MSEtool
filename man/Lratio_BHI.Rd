\usage{
Lratio_BHI(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE, yrsmth = 3)

Lratio_BHI2(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE, yrsmth = 3)

Lratio_BHI3(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE, yrsmth = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{A data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s)}

\item{plot}{Logical. Show the plot?}

\item{yrsmth}{The most recent years of data to smooth the calculation of the mean length}
}
\value{

}
\description{
The TAC is calculated as the most recent catch, modified by the ratio alpha,
where the numerator is the mean length of the catch (of lengths larger than Lc) and
the denominator is the mean length expected at MSY. Here, Lc is the length at
full selection (LFS).
}
\details{
The TAC is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC}_y = C_{y-1} \frac{L}{L_\textrm{ref}}}
where \eqn{C_{y-1}} is the catch from the previous year, \eqn{L} is the mean
length of the catch over the last \code{yrsmth} years (of lengths larger than Lc) and \eqn{L_\textrm{ref}} is the
mean length expected at MSY. Here, Lc is the length at full selection (LFS).

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{Lratio_BHI}: Assumes M/K = 1.5 and FMSY/M = 1. Natural mortality M and von Bertalanffy
K are not used in this MP (see Appendix A of Jardim et al. 2015).

\item \code{Lratio_BHI2}: More general version that calculates the reference mean length as a
function of M, K, and presumed FMSY/M.

\item \code{Lratio_BHI3}: A modified version of Lratio_BHI2 where mean length
is calculated for lengths > modal length (Lc)
