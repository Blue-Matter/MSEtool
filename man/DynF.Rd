\description{
The Fratio MP with a controller that changes the level of F according to the
estimated relationship between surplus production and biomass. Ie lower F when dSP/dB
is positive and higher F when dSP/dB is negative.
}
\details{
The method smoothes historical catches and biomass and then infers the
relationship between surplus production and biomass (as suggested by Mark
Maunder and Carl Walters). The approach then regulates a F based policy
according to this gradient in which F may range between two different
fractions of natural mortality rate.

The core advantage is the TAC(t) is not strongly determined by TAC(t-1) and
therefore errors are not as readily propagated. The result is method that
tends to perform alarmingly well and therefore requires debunking ASAP.

The catch limit (TAC) is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC}=F  B}
where \eqn{F} is fishing mortality and \eqn{B} is the estimated current biomass.

\eqn{F} is calculated as:
\deqn{F = F_{\textrm{MSY}} \exp{-gG}}
where \eqn{F_{\textrm{MSY}}} is calculated from assumed values of \eqn{\frac{F_{\textrm{MSY}}}{M}} and
\eqn{M}, \emph{g} is a gain parameter and \emph{G} is the estimated gradient in surplus
production (\emph{SP}) as a function of biomass (\emph{B}). Surplus production for year \emph{y} is calculated as:
\deqn{SP_y = B_{y+1} - B_y + C_y}
Trends in historical catch (\emph{C}) and biomass (\emph{B}) are both estimated using a loess smoother, over the last \code{yrsmth} years,
of available catch and a time-series of abundance, calculated from an index of abundance (\code{Data@Ind})
and an estimate of abundance (\code{Data@Abun}) for the current year.
