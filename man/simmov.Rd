\title{Calculates movement matrices from user inputs}
\usage{
simmov(
  OM,
  dist = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4),
  prob = 0.5,
  distE = 0.1,
  probE = 0.1,
  prob2 = NA,
  figure = TRUE
)

plot_mov(mov, age = 1, type = c("matrix", "all"), year = 1, qval = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{OM}{Operating model, an object of class \linkS4class{OM}.}

\item{dist}{A vector of fractions of unfished stock in each area. The length of this vector will determine the
number of areas (\code{nareas}) in the OM.}

\item{prob}{Mean probability of staying across all areas (single value) or a vector of the probability of
individuals staying in each area (same length as dist).}

\item{distE}{Logit (normal) St.Dev error for sampling stock fractions from the fracs vector}

\item{probE}{Logit (normal) St.Dev error for sampling desired probability of staying either by area
(prob is same length as dist) or the mean probability of staying (prob is a single number).}

\item{prob2}{Optional vector as long as prob and dist. Upper bounds on uniform sampling of
probability of staying, lower bound is prob.}

\item{figure}{Logical to indicate if the movement matrix will be plotted (mean values and range
across \code{OM@nsim} simulations.)}

\item{mov}{A four-dimensional array of dimension \code{c(nsim, maxage, nareas, nareas)} or a five-dimensional
array of dimension \code{c(nsim, maxage, nareas, nareas, nyears + proyears)} specifying movement
in the operating model.}

\item{age}{An age from 0 to maxage for the movement-at-age matrix figure when \code{type = "matrix"}.}

\item{type}{Whether to plot a movement matrix for a single age (\code{"matrix"}) or the
full movement versus age figure (\code{"all"})}

\item{year}{If \code{mov} is a 5-dimensional array, the year (from 1 to nyears + proyears) for which
to plot movement.}

\item{qval}{The quantile to plot or report the range of values among simulations.}
}
\value{
The operating model \code{OM} with movement parameters in slot \code{cpars}.
The \code{mov} array is of dimension \code{nsim}, \code{maxage}, \code{nareas}, \code{nareas}.
}
\description{
A wrapper function for \link{makemov} used to generate movement matrices for the operating model.
Calculates a movement matrix from user-specified unfished stock biomass fraction in each area and probability of
staying in the area in each time step.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{simmov()}: Estimation function for creating movement matrix.

\item \code{plot_mov()}: Plotting function.

}}
\note{
Array \code{mov} is age-specific, but currently the movement generated by \code{simmov} is
independent of age.
