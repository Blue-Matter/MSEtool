\title{Calculates Vulnerable Biomass by Fleet and Area}
\usage{
CalcVBiomass(
  NumberAtAgeArea,
  FleetWeightAtAgeFleet,
  SelectivityAtAgeFleet,
  ClosureFleetArea
)
}
\arguments{
\item{NumberAtAgeArea}{Numeric matrix of number-at-age with \code{nAge} rows and \code{nArea} columns}

\item{FleetWeightAtAgeFleet}{Numeric matrix of mean weight-at-age with \code{nAge} rows and \code{nFleet} columns}

\item{SelectivityAtAgeFleet}{Numeric matrix of selectivity-at-age with \code{nAge} rows and \code{nFleet} columns}

\item{ClosureFleetArea}{Boolean matrix of area closures \code{nFleet} rows and \code{nArea} columns; 0 for closed, 1 for open}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix of vulnerable biomass with \code{nFleet} rows and \code{nArea} columns
}
\description{
Vulnerable biomass is defined as the selected age-classes in areas that are
open to fishing.
}
\details{
All matrices must have the correct dimensions:
\itemize{
\item \code{nAge} is calculated from \code{nrow(NumberAtAgeArea)}
\item \code{nArea} is calculated from \code{ncol(NumberAtAgeArea)}
\item \code{nFleet} is calculated from \code{ncol(FleetWeightAtAgeFleet)}
}
}
