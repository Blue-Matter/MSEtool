\title{Calculates movement matrices from user inputs for fraction in each area (fracs) the relative fraction moving to other areas, plus a mean probability of staying in any given area.}
\usage{
makemov2(
  dist = c(0.05, 0.6, 0.35),
  prob = 0.5,
  probE = 1,
  frac_other = matrix(c(NA, 2, 1, 2, NA, 1, 1, 2, NA), nrow = 3, byrow = T),
  plot = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist}{A vector nareas long of fractions of unfished stock biomass in each area}

\item{prob}{A vector of the probability of individuals staying in each area or a single value for the mean probability of staying among all areas}

\item{probE}{The logit CV associated with prob (used as a penalty when optimizing for diagonal)}

\item{frac_other}{A matrix nareas x nareas that specifies the relative fraction moving from one area to the others. The positive diagonal is unspecified.}

\item{plot}{Should the convergence to a stable distribution be plotted?}
}
\description{
A function for calculating a movement matrix from user specified distribution among areas (v) and relative movement to other areas (solves for positive diagonal - vector of prob staying).
Used by \link{simmov2} to generate movement matrices for an operating model. There must be a prior on the positive diagonal of the movement matrix or these will tend to 1
and hence perfectly satisfy the requirement V = MV.
