\description{
An MP that uses Martell and Froese (2012) method for estimating MSY to
determine the OFL. Since their approach estimates stock trajectories based
on catches and a rule for intrinsic rate of increase it also returns
depletion. Given their surplus production model predicts K, r and depletion
it is straighforward to calculate the OFL based on the Schaefer productivity
curve.
}
\details{
The TAC is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC} = D K \frac{r}{2}}
where \eqn{D} is depletion, \eqn{K} is unfished biomass, and \eqn{r} is
intrinsic rate of increasase, all estimated internally by the method based
on trends in the catch data and life-history information.

Requires the assumption that catch is proportional to abundance, and a catch
time-series from the beginning of exploitation.

Occasionally the rule that limits r and K ranges does not allow r-K pairs to
be found that lead to the depletion inferred by the catch trajectories. In
this case this method widens the search.
