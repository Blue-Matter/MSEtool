\usage{
Simulate(OM = MSEtool::testOM, parallel = FALSE, silent = FALSE)

Project(
  Hist = NULL,
  MPs = NA,
  parallel = FALSE,
  silent = FALSE,
  extended = FALSE,
  checkMPs = TRUE

  OM = MSEtool::testOM,
  MPs = NA,
  Hist = FALSE,
  silent = FALSE,

  extended = FALSE,
  checkMPs = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{OM}{An operating model object (class \code{OM} or class \code{Hist})}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Should the MSE be run using parallel processing? See Details for more information.}

\item{silent}{Should messages be printed out to the console?}

\item{Hist}{Should model stop after historical simulations? Returns an object of
class 'Hist' containing all historical data}

\item{MPs}{A vector of methods (character string) of class MP}

\item{extended}{Logical. Return extended projection results?
if TRUE, \code{MSE@Misc$extended} is a named list with extended data
(including historical and projection by area), and extended version of \code{MSE@Hist}
is returned.}

\item{checkMPs}{Logical. Check if the specified MPs exist and can be run on \code{SimulatedData}?}
}
\value{
Functions return objects of class \linkS4class{Hist} or \linkS4class{MSE}
\itemize{
\item Simulate - An object of class \linkS4class{Hist}
\item Project - An object of class \linkS4class{MSE}
\item runMSE - An object of class \linkS4class{MSE}
}

Functions to run the Management Strategy Evaluation (closed-loop
simulation) for a specified operating model

\details{
\subsection{Running in Parallel}{

For simple MPs, running in parallel can actually lead to an increase in computation time, due to the overhead in sending the
information over to the cores. Consequently, the data-limied MPs in DLMtool and the reference MPs in MSEtool are not run using parallel processing.
All other MPs, including custom MPs, will be run in parallel if argument is TRUE.
To individually control which MPs run in parallel, \code{parallel} can be a named list of logical values, e.g., \code{parallel=list(AvC=TRUE)}.
