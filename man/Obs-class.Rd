\note{
Its questionable whether the hyperstability/hyperdepletion should be
categorised as an observation model characteristic as it is most often
driven by fleet dynamics (and therefore should be in the fleet object). Oh
well its here and you might want to make it hyperstable beta < 1 or
hyperdeplete beta > 1, only.
