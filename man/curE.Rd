\usage{
curE(x, Data, reps, plot = FALSE)

curE75(x, Data, reps, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{A data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s)}

\description{
Constant fishing effort set at final year of historical simulations subject
to changes in catchability determined by \code{OM@qinc} and interannual variability
in catchability determined by \code{OM@qcv}. This MP is intended to represent a
'status quo' management approach.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{curE}: Set effort to 100\\% of that in final year of historical simulations.

\item \code{curE75}: Set effort to 75\\% of that in final year.
