\title{Average Catch with a size limit}
\usage{
AvC_MLL(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{A data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s)}

\item{plot}{Logical. Show the plot?}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[=Rec-class]{Rec}} with the TAC, Retention slot(s) populated
}
\description{
A example mixed control MP that uses the average catch output control MP together with a
minimul size limit set at the size of maturity.
}
\details{
The average catch method is very simple. The mean historical catch is calculated and used to set
a constant catch limit (TAC). If \code{reps} > 1 then the \code{reps} samples are drawn from a log-normal
distribution with mean \code{TAC} and standard deviation (in log-space) of 0.2.

For completeness, the TAC is calculated by:

\deqn{\textrm{TAC} =\frac{\sum_{y=1}^{\textrm{n}}{C_y}}{\textrm{n}}}

where \eqn{\textrm{TAC}} is the the mean catch recommendation, \eqn{n} is the number of historical years, and
\eqn{C_y}  is the catch in historical year \eqn{y}.

The size of retention is set to the length of maturity.

This MP has been included for demonstration purposes of a mixed control MP.
