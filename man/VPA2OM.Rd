\arguments{
\item{Name}{Character string. The name of the operating model.}

\item{proyears}{Positive integer. The number of projection years for MSE.}

\item{interval}{Positive integer. The interval at which management procedures will update the management advice in \link[DLMtool]{runMSE}, e.g., 1 = annual updates.}

\item{CurrentYr}{Positive integer. The current year (final year of VPA fitting to data)}

\item{h}{Numeric value greater than 0.2 and less than 1. The steepness of the stock-recruitment curve (assumed to be close to 1 to match VPA assumption).}

\item{Obs}{The observation model (class Obs). This function only updates the catch and index observation error.}

\item{Imp}{The implementation model (class Imp). This function does not update implementation parameters.}

\item{naa}{Numeric array \link{sim, ages, year}. Numbers-at-age \link{first age is age zero}.}

\item{faa}{Numeric array \link{sim, ages, year}. Fishing mortality rate-at-age \link{first age is age zero}.}

\item{waa}{Numeric array \link{sim, ages, year}. Weight-at-age \link{first age is age zero}.}

\item{Mataa}{Numeric array \link{sim, ages, year}. Maturity (spawning fraction)-at-age \link{first age is age zero}.}

\item{Maa}{Numeric array \link{sim, ages, year}. Natural mortality rate-at-age \link{first age is age zero}.}

\item{laa}{Numeric array \link{sim, ages, year}. Length-at-age \link{first age is age zero}.}

\item{nyr_par_mu}{Positive integer. The number of recent years that natural mortality, age vulnerability, weight, length and maturity parameters are averaged over for defining future projection conditions.}

\item{LowerTri}{Integer. The number of recent years for which model estimates of recruitment are ignored (not reliably estimated by the VPA)}

\item{recind}{Positive integer. The first age class that fish 'recruit to the fishery'. The default is 2 - ie the first position in the age dimension of naa is age zero}

\item{plusgroup}{Logical. Does the VPA assume that the oldes age class is a plusgroup?}

\item{altinit}{Integer. Various assumptions for how VPAs set up the initial numbers. 0: standard, 1: no plus group, 2: temporary fix for DLMtool plus group initialization}

\item{fixq1}{Logical. Should q be fixed (ie assume the F-at-age array faa is accurate?}

\item{report}{Logical, if TRUE, a diagnostic will be reported showing the matching of the OM reconstructed numbers at age vs the VPA assessment.}

\item{silent}{Whether to silence messages to the console.}

An object of class \linkS4class{OM}.

\description{
A function that uses a set of VPA bootstrap estimates of numbers-at-age, fishing mortality rate-at-age, M-at-age,
weight-at-age, length-at-age and Maturity-at-age to define a fully described DLMtool / MSEtool operating model. The user still
needs to parameterize most of the observation and implementation portions of the operating model.
