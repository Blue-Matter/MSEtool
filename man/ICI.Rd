\title{Index Confidence Interval}
\usage{
ICI(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE)

ICI2(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{A data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s)}

\item{plot}{Logical. Show the plot?}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[=Rec-class]{Rec}} with the TAC slot(s) populated
}
\description{
The MP adjusts catch based on the value of the index in the current year relative to the
time series mean and standard error.
}
\details{
The TAC is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC}_y=C_{y-1} \alpha}
where \eqn{C_{y-1}} is the catch from the previous year, and \eqn{\alpha} is
defined as:
\deqn{\alpha = 
             \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
             d & \textrm{if } I < \textrm{CI}_L \\ 
             u & \textrm{if } I > \textrm{CI}_H \\ 
             1 & \textrm{if } \textrm{CI}_L \leq I \leq \textrm{CI}_H \\
             \end{array}\right.
           }{}
where \eqn{I} is the index in the most recent year, \eqn{d} is 0.75 for \code{ICI} and \code{ICI2},
\eqn{u} is 1.05 and 1.25 for\code{ICI} and \code{ICI2} respectively, and \eqn{\textrm{CI}_L}
and \eqn{\textrm{CI}_L} are the lower and upper bound of the confidence
interval of mean historical index. The confidence interval is
calculated using Z-scores described in the Functions section below.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{ICI}: The catch is reduced by 0.75 if the Z-score of the current year's index is less than -0.44.
The catch is increased by 1.05 if the Z-score of the current year's index is greater than 1.96. Otherwise, the catch is held constant.

\item \code{ICI2}: This method is less precautionary of the two ICI MPs by allowing for a
larger increase in TAC and a lower threshold of the index to decrease the TAC. The catch is reduced by 0.75
if the Z-score of the current year's index is less than -1.96. The catch is increased by 1.25
if the Z-score of the current year's index is greater than 1.96. Otherwise, the catch is held constant.
