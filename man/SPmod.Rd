\title{Surplus production based catch-limit modifier}
\usage{
SPmod(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE, alp = c(0.8, 1.2), bet = c(0.8, 1.2))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{A data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s)}

\item{plot}{Logical. Show the plot?}

\item{alp}{Condition for modifying the TAC (bounds on change in abundance)}

\item{bet}{Limits for how much the TAC can change among years}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[=Rec-class]{Rec}} with the TAC slot(s) populated

A numeric vector of TAC recommendations
}
\description{
An MP that makes incremental adjustments to TAC recommendations based on the
apparent trend in surplus production. Based on the theory of Mark Maunder
(IATTC)
}
\details{
Note that this isn't exactly what Mark has previously suggested and is
stochastic in this implementation.

The TAC is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC}_y = 
             \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
              C_{y-1} \textrm{bet}_1 & \textrm{if } r < \alpha_1 \\ 
              C_{y-1} & \textrm{if } \alpha_1 < r < \alpha_2 \\
              \textrm{bet}_2 (b_2 - b_1 + C_{y-2} )  & \textrm{if } r > \alpha_2 \\  
             \end{array}\right.
           }{}
where \eqn{\textrm{bet}_1} and \eqn{\textrm{bet}_2} are elements in \code{bet},
\eqn{r} is the ratio of the index in the most recent two years, \eqn{C_{y-1}}
is catch in the previous year, \eqn{b_1} and \eqn{b_2} are ratio of index
in \eqn{y-2} and \eqn{y-1} over the estimate of catchability \eqn{\left(\frac{I}{A}\right)},
and \eqn{\alpha_1}, \eqn{\alpha_2}, and \eqn{\alpha_3} are specified in argument
\code{alp}.
