\title{Mean Catch Depletion}
\usage{
MCD(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE)

MCD4010(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{A data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s)}

\item{plot}{Logical. Show the plot?}
}
\value{

}
\description{
A simple average catch-depletion MP that was included to demonstrate just
how informative an estimate of current stock depletion can be.
}
\details{
The TAC is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC} = 2 \bar{C} D }
where \eqn{\bar{C}} is mean historical catch, and \eqn{D} is estimate of current
depletion.

The TAC is modified by a harvest control rule in \code{MCD4010}.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{MCD}: The calculated TAC = 2 \* depletion \* AvC

\item \code{MCD4010}: Linked to a 40-10 harvest control rule
