\arguments{
\item{Name}{Name of the Operating Model. Character string.}

\item{Agency}{Name of the agency responsible for the management of the fishery.
Character string. Supports Markdown.}

\item{Author}{Name(s) of author(s) of the operating model. Character string
with length corresponding to the number of authors.}

\item{Email}{Email address(es) for the author(s) of the operating model.
Character string of with length equal to \code{length(Author)}. Supports Markdown.}

\item{Region}{Name of the general geographic region of the fishery. Character string.}

\item{Latitude}{Latitude (decimal degrees) to indicate the center of \code{Region}.
Negative values represent the South of the Equator. Numeric. Single value.}

\item{Longitude}{Longitude (decimal degrees) to indicate the center of \code{Region}.
Negative values represent the West of the Prime Meridian. Numeric. Single value.}

\item{Sponsor}{Name of the organization who sponsored the development of the
Operating Model. Character string. Supports Markdown.}

\item{nSim}{The number of simulations. Numeric. Positive integer \code{nSim=1} will
produce a deterministic operating model.}

\item{nYear}{The number of historical years. Typically corresponds to the
year the fishery was first (assumed to be) exploited. For multi-stock models,
\code{nYear} should be the earliest exploitation year of all stocks. Numeric.
Single value. Historical years are calculated as \code{rev(seq(CurrentYear, by=-1, length.out=nYear))}}

\item{pYear}{The number of projection years. Numeric. Single value.
Projection years are calculated as \code{seq(CurrentYear+1, length.out=pYear)}.}

\item{CurrentYear}{The last historical year of the operating model. Defaults
to the year the Operating Model object is built.}

\item{Stock}{A \link{Stock} object or a list of \code{\link[=Stock]{Stock()}} objects
for multi-stock models.}

\item{Complexes}{For multi-stock models only. A list of stock complexes.
Each position is a vector of stock numbers (as they appear in \code{Stock} list)
for which data and management recommendation should be aggregated; e.g.,
TAC will be split among stocks according to vulnerable biomass.}

\item{Relations}{For multi-stock models only. A list of biological and/or
ecological relationships among stocks in \code{Stock}. For MICE models. Needs
more documentation so bug us if you get stuck.}

\item{SexPars}{For multi-stock models only. A named list that controls
sex-specific dynamics, i.e., sex-specific spawning and hermaphroditism.
More generally, controls spawning and moving abundance between stocks. See \code{Details}.}

\item{Data}{A \code{\link[=data-class]{data-class()}} object or a list of \code{\link[=data-class]{data-class()}} objects (up to
\code{length(Stock)}) containing the real fishery data.
if \code{Complexes} is specified, \code{Data} follows the same structure, i.e., elements
in \code{Data} list will be assumed to be aggregated according to \code{Complexes}.}

\item{DataLag}{Integer length 1. The number of time steps to lag the data.
Default \code{DataLage=0} means data is generated up to the time step before an MP is implemented.
E.g., if management advice is being produced for \code{TimeStep=2025}, the data provided to the MP
will be up to and including \code{2024}.}

\item{Interval}{Integer length 1. The management update interval. Management will be implemented
in the first projection time step, and then every \code{Interval} time step, with
management remaining unchanged in the interim. A single numeric value for the
same interval for all managemement procedures. For MP-specific management
intervals , \code{Interval} can be a named numeric vector with length corresponding
to the number of management procedures used in \code{\link[=runMSE]{runMSE()}} or \code{\link[=Project]{Project()}}.}

\item{nReps}{Number of samples of the management recommendation for each method.
Only for management procedures that generate stochastic management advice (i.e.,
account for uncertainty in the data). Defaults to 1, which produces deterministic
management advice.}

\item{pStar}{The percentile of the sample of the management recommendation for each method.
Defaults to 0.5 (median). Only for management procedures that generate
stochastic management advice (i.e., account for uncertainty in the data).
To ensure the management advice matches the correct percentile, \code{reps} should
be a largish value (i.e., >>1, but exact value depends on the degree of uncertainty in the data)}

\item{Seed}{Optional numeric value for the seed for the random number generator.
Only required to over-ride the default seed (calculated internally based on
the contents of the \code{OM} object)}

\item{Control}{A named list of settings. See \code{Details}}

\item{Misc}{A list for storing additional things that don't have anywhere else to go.
Mainly for development purposes.}

\item{Source}{Character string. Can be used to reference websites, articles, etc
with relevant information. Supports Markdown.}

Class \code{om}: Operating Model Object
}
\details{
\subsection{About the \code{om} Class}{

\code{om} is a new S4 class that is designed to supersede \code{\link[=OM-class]{OM-class()}} and \code{\link[=MOM-class]{MOM-class()}}
objects. In time, \code{\link[=OM-class]{OM-class()}} and \code{\link[=MOM-class]{MOM-class()}} will be deprecated
and eventually removed from the package.
}

\subsection{Creating New Objects}{

New \code{om} objects can be created with \code{Om()}, see \code{Usage} and \code{Examples} for details.
}

\subsection{Accessing and Assigning Slots}{

Like all of the new style objects in \code{MSEtool}, the slots in \code{om} objects can be accessed and assigned with functions matching the slot names. See \verb{See Also} section for functions.
}

\subsection{SexPars}{

The following are valid names for \code{SexPars}:
\itemize{
\item \code{SPfrom}: A \code{nstock} x \code{nstock} matrix, where \code{nstock} is \verb{length(Stock})
that specifies the proportion of the spawning output of the row \code{p} stock for
the column \verb{p'} stock. A diagonal matrix means each stock is responsible for
its own recruitment.
\item \code{Herm}: A list with each entry containing a matrix with
dimensions \code{c(nSim, MaxAge + 1)} that specifies the proportion at age that move from
stock \code{p} to \verb{p'} (sequential hermaphroditism). The names of the list should be
of the form "H_p'_p" where \code{p} and \verb{p'} are integers that identify the stocks
in the \code{Stock} list. For time-varying values, arrays with dimensions
\code{c(nSim, (MaxAge + 1),nHistTS + nProjTS)} can be used. \code{MaxAge} is the maximum age
for the both stock \code{p} and stock \verb{p'}. \code{nHistTS} and \code{nProjTS} are equal to
\code{nYear} and \code{pYear} respectively, unless \code{Units} in the stocks' \code{\link[=Ages]{Ages()}}
object are not \code{year} (i.e, a higher resolution time step).
\item \code{SharePar}: Optional. Logical to indicate whether stock-recruit, depletion,
and observation/implementation parameters are mirrored between stocks. By default, \code{TRUE}.
}
}

\subsection{Control}{

The following are valid names for \code{Control}:

TODO
