\title{Create indices that are sampled at various frequencies}
\usage{
doIfreq(I_hist, I_freq, LHYr, CurYr, Year)
}
\arguments{
\item{I_hist}{Vector of real numbers, concatinated observed (historical) and simulated (projected) indices.}

\item{I_freq}{Positive integer. The frequency of index sampling (e.g. 1 is every year, 2 is every 2 years - a gap every 2 years in the projected, simulated data).}

\item{LHYr}{Positive integer, a year (e.g. 2023), the last historical year, demarks the historical period where observations have been collected from the projected period where sparsity is to be simulated.}

\item{CurYr}{Positive integer, a year (e.g. 2043), the most recent year of the simulation.}

\item{Year}{Vector of positive integers (as long as I_hist), the years corresponding with I_hist.}
}
\value{
A thinned ector I_hist long of index observations.
}
\description{
Given an index (historical period and projected period) this function creates sparsity in the projected index to simulate varying frequency (intensity) of data collection.
