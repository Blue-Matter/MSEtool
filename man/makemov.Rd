\title{Calculates movement matrices from user inputs for fraction in each area (fracs) and probability of staying in areas (prob)}
\usage{
makemov(fracs = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4), prob = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95))
}
\arguments{
\item{fracs}{A vector nareas long of fractions of unfished stock biomass in each area}

\item{prob}{A vector of the probability of individuals staying in each area or a single value for the mean probability of staying among all areas}
}
\description{
A function for calculating a movement matrix from user specified unfished stock biomass fraction in each area.
Used by \link{simmov} to generate movement matrices for an operating model.
