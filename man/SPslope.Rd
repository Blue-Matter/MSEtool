\description{
A management procedure that makes incremental adjustments to TAC
recommendations based on the apparent trend in recent surplus production.
Based on the theory of Mark Maunder (IATTC)
}
\details{
Note that this isn't exactly what Mark has previously suggested and is
stochastic in this implementation.

The TAC is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC}_y = 
             \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
              M \bar{C}  & \textrm{if } r < \alpha_1 \\ 
              \bar{C} & \textrm{if } \alpha_1 < r < \alpha_2 \\
              \textrm{bet}_2 \textrm{SP}  & \textrm{if } r > \alpha_2 \\  
             \end{array}\right.
           }{}
where \eqn{r} is the ratio of predicted biomass in next year to biomass in
current year \eqn{\bar{C}} is the mean catch over the last \code{yrmsth} years, \eqn{\alpha_1}
and  \eqn{\alpha_2} are specified in \code{alp}, \eqn{\textrm{bet}_1} and \eqn{\textrm{bet}_2}
are specified in \code{bet}, \eqn{\textrm{SP}} is estimated surplus production in most recent year,
and:
\deqn{M = 1-\textrm{bet}_1 \frac{B_y - \tilde{B}_y}{B_y}}
where \eqn{B_y} is the most recent estimate of biomass and \eqn{\tilde{B}}
is the predicted biomass in the next year.
