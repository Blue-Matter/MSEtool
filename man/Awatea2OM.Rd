\description{
A function that generates an operating model from the MCMC samples of an Awatea model.
Code optimized for the BC Pacific ocean perch assessment (Haigh et al. 2018).
}
\details{
This function averages biological parameters across sex and then sends arrays to \link{VPA2OM}, assumes
unfished status (B/B0 = 1) in the first year, and assumes a single fishing fleet.
