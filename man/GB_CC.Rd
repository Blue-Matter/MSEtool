\title{Geromont and Butterworth Constant Catch Harvest Control Rule}
\usage{
GB_CC(x, Data, reps = 100, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{A data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the MP recommendation(s)}

\item{plot}{Logical. Show the plot?}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[=Rec-class]{Rec}} with the TAC slot(s) populated
}
\description{
A simple MP that aims for a reference catch (as a proxy for MSY)
subject to imperfect information.
}
\details{
Note that this is my interpretation of their MP and is now stochastic.
Currently it is generalized and is not 'tuned' to more detailed assessment
data which might explain why in some cases it leads to stock declines.

The TAC is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC} = C_\textrm{ref}}
where \eqn{C_\textrm{ref}} is a reference catch assumed to be a proxy for MSY.
In the MSE \eqn{C_\textrm{ref}} is the calculated MSY subject to observation error
defined in \code{Obs@CV_Cref}.

The TAC is subject to the following conditions:
\enumerate{
\item if next TAC > 1.2 last catch, then TAC = 1.2 last catch
\item if next TAC < 0.8 last catch, then TAC = 0.8 last catch
}
